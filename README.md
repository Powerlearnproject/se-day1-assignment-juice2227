Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining sofwares
importance of software engineering is as follows:
1.To build realibale and scalable software solutions to meet the business and users needs effectively.
2.It improves  opearational effeciency across different industries.
3.It plays a vital role in software security by ensuring software run smoothly and efficiently.
4.It promotes collaboration and communication among team members, stake holders and end-users.
5.It emphasizes writing clean, modular, and well-documented code, which simplifies maintenance and future development


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Emergence of Structured Programming
   This was in the late 1960s-1970s this was the growing diculty of developing large and reliable software systems.The rise of structured was a important response empahisizing logical       program strucrures and reducing complexity.
2.Advent of object-oriented Programming(OOP)
   This was in 1980s-1990s , OOP brought a paradigm shift by focusing on objects that encapusulate data and behaviour. This approach promoted code reusability, maintability and scalibity.
3.The agile Revolution and DevOps
This is/was in the late 20th and 21st century .Agile empahisiszes iterative development, collaboration and responsiveness to change while devOps focuses on automating and streamlining the software delivery process
   

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has several phases, including planning, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 
  1.Design 
    This involves:
    a)create the software's architecture and user interface
    b) Outline the specifics of the application 
   c) Convert the SRS document into a logiacl structure

2.Coding 
  This involves:
   a) Develop the software by writing code

3.Testing 
This involves:
      a)identify and fix bugs to ensure quality
      b)verify the functionality of the system
      c)Ensure that it meets the specified requirements 

4.Deployment 
This involves:
    Release the software to users
   a) Move the software from the testing environment to the operating environment
   b) Release the software to users
   c) Move the software from the testing environment to the operating environment 

5.Maintenance
This involves:
   a) Continuously support and improve the software post-deployment
    b)Ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the end-users 

    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Agile is an iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, continuous feedback, and incremental delivery.

Example scenarios of waterfall methodolies:
  a)Building a bridge where safety requirements are non-negotiable and designs must be approved before construction
  b)FDA-regulated medical device development where documentation is legally required before implementation
  c) Government contracts with fixed requirements and deliverables

  Example scenarios of Agile Methodologies:
    a)Developing a new mobile app where user feedback will shape future features
    b)Creating a startup's minimum viable product that needs to adapt to market conditions
    c)Enterprise software development where business needs may shift during implementation

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
